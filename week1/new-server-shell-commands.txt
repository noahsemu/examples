# For editing files, use the command "nano" if you're new to the linux command
# line. Going forward, it's a good thing to learn either "vi" or "emacs", the
# two standard linux command line text editors. Google for tutorials on how to
# use either vi or emacs.

# When you've created a python script you want to execute, you can run it with:
python FILENAME

# If you get an error that the "python" command is not found, it means you need
# to run "pipenv shell" to get your environment set correctly for the directory.
